# CISC181_Checkpoint
Main Project in CISC181, a game based on Chess

This was a project made for CISC181 - Intro to Computer Science II. 
It is a game similar to chess where the goal is to either eliminate all 
the other player's pieces or––more often––gain enough money by capturing their pieces.

Don't have much else to say about this. Just a neat little game.
